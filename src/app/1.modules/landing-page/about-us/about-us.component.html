            a lifetime maker of things. Cassandra spent a good portion of her youth studying fine arts and printmaking,
            but In 2006 she moved to Tokyo and realized quickly that there wasnâ€™t much space for 2D art in the
            traditional sense, so she felt compelled to move toward a more utilitarian outlet to satisfy her drive to
            make. She spent 10 years of her career teaching handknitting in her small yarn shop in West Tokyo but
            ultimately desired a close working relationship with other master craftspeople. In 2019 she began studying
            with Master Teruo Hirokawa, and doing what she could to become a competent trouser maker. She still writes
            the occasional knitting pattern for yarn companies and magazines, and is also involved in yarn design,
            however she spends most of her waking hours in her tiny studio in Fuchu crafting wool garments. </p>
