          <div>Cassandra Harada has been knitting and making garments with natural fibers for over 22 years.
            She has been designing for publications like “Keitodama” and contributing to seasonal collections for
            yarn companies like Jamieson’s of Shetland for 15 years. While designing patterns for original knitwear
            is a joy, Cassandra really prefers to work with singular customers who are in need of something specific
            to suit their needs.</div>
